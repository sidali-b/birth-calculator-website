             <h1>AKAN<span>NAMES</span>.</h1>
             <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first
              name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
              These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle
              names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
              ancestor's middle name.
